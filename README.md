## State of art
The text chosen to perform text sentiment analysis is titled "Main reasons for abandoning a pet animal". The study is about dog and cat abandonment in Spain and it explains the main causes and gives some advice to avoid abandonment.


## Conclusions
- If we delete the stopwords, the most frequent words are "animal", "abandon", "pet", "dog" and "cat" so we can get a general idea about what is the text about without even reading it.

- The text I have chosen to perform the sentiment analysis to is more positive than negative, though, in general, it is neutral.

- We can see that the predominant emotion in the text is sadness and fear, followed by surprise and hapiness. I think it is normal since the text is about the abandonment of dogs and cats..
